#TheoreticalFoundationsOfComputing
### Some summaries that helped me on topics of Theoretical Foundations of Computacion. ###
### The files [megersort.py](https://github.com/guilhermea23/TheoreticalFoundationsOfComputing/blob/main/mergesort.py) and [CaesarCipher.py](https://github.com/guilhermea23/TheoreticalFoundationsOfComputing/blob/main/CaesarCipher.py) I found search about the _Sorting Algorithms_ and _Caesar Cipher_, respectively, but I didn't copy the url of repository, but I just use to study about the theme. ###
