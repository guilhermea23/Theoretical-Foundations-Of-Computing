# TheoreticalFoundationsOfComputing
### Some summaries that helped me on topics of Theoretical Foundations of Computacion. ###
### The files [megersort.py](https://github.com/guilhermea23/TheoreticalFoundationsOfComputing/blob/main/mergesort.py) and [CaesarCipher.py](https://github.com/guilhermea23/TheoreticalFoundationsOfComputing/blob/main/CaesarCipher.py) I found searching about the themes, but I didn't copy the url of repositories that were in, but I just used to study about the theme with them. ###
